    <h1><center>What is the Majorana 1 chip</center></h1>
    </font>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p><center>The Majorana 1 chip is a quantum computing device that was developed by<br> 
      Microsoft as an effort to create a topological quantum computer. Unlike most quantum<br>
      chips that rely on fragile qubits prone to errors and decoherence, the Majorana 1 chip is<br> 
      built to explore the use of Majorana zero modes(MZMs) exotic quasiparticles theorized<br>
      to be their own antiparticles as the basis for topological qubits.</center></p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p><center>The chip leverages a specialized nanofabrication design, combining<br> 
      semiconductor nanowires and superconducting materials, under carefully controlled<br> 
      conditions (ultra-low temperatures and strong magnetic fields). The idea is to trap<br> 
      MZMs at the ends of these nanowires. Because of their non-local quantum properties,<br> 
      information stored in these modes would, in theory, be inherently protected from local<br> 
      disturbances, providing a highly stable form of qubit.</center></p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p><center>However, the Majorana 1 chip is not yet a functioning quantum processor. It is<br> 
      best described as a test platform, built to detect signatures of MZMs using<br> 
      interferometric methods. While Microsoft claims progress, the scientific community<br> 
      remains cautious, as the observed signals could also be explained by more<br> 
      conventional phenomena like Andreev bound states. This uncertainty has led to<br> 
      ongoing scrutiny and debate over validity of the evidence presented.</center></p>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p><center>Despite the skepticism, the chip represents a significant step in exploring<br> 
      topological quantum computing, a field that, if successful, could overcome some of the<br> 
      biggest challenges in building scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers.</center></p>
