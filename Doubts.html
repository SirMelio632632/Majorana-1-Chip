        <h3>Challenges in Distinguishing MZMs</h3>
        <p>One of the central challenges is differentiating true Majorana zero modes from Andreev bound states, 
            which can produce similar experimental signatures. Both phenomena can exist in the types of devices Microsoft is constructing, 
            making it difficult to definitively attribute observed results to MZMs. This ambiguity was also a factor in the retraction of a high-profile Nature article in 2018, 
            where initial claims of observing MZMs were later attributed to Andreev bound states.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="card card2">
        <h3>Lack of Quantum Coherence</h3>
        <p>While Microsoft refers to the Majorana 1 as a "quantum processing unit," 
            the current demonstrations focus solely on readout methods and do not showcase coherent quantum operations or logic gates. 
            This absence of demonstrated quantum coherence raises questions about the chip's functionality as a true quantum processor.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="card card3">
        <h3>Skepticism from the Scientific Community </h3>
        <p>Physicists and experts have expressed reservations about Microsoft's claims. 
            For instance, at the Global Physics Summit, Microsoft's presentation did not convince many skeptics, 
            as the evidence for Majorana qubits was deemed insufficient. 
            Additionally, internal discussions among Amazon's quantum team criticized Microsoft's assertions, 
            with some executives labeling the claims as exaggerated and lacking robust scientific backing.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="card card4">
        <h3>Concerns over Marketing</h3>
        <p>Some scientists have pointed out a discrepancy between Microsoft's marketing narratives and the scientific data presented. 
            While Microsoft's press releases suggest a groundbreaking achievement, the actual peer-reviewed paper describes a foundational experiment or "test harness" for MZMs,
            rather than a demonstrable quantum computing chip.
            This has led to concerns that the company's public statements may overstate the current capabilities of the Majorana 1 chip.</p>
      </div>

      
      <div class="card card5">
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>The skepticism is further compounded by Microsoft's history in this area. 
            In 2018, a Microsoft-led team published a paper claiming the observation of MZMs, 
            which was later retracted after it was determined that the data could be explained by non-topological phenomena. 
            This past incident has made the scientific community more cautious in evaluating Microsoft's current claims.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="card card6">
        <h3>Independent Verification</h3>
        <p>While Microsoft's findings have been published in a reputable journal, the broader scientific community emphasizes the need for independent
             replication and verification of results. Without corroborating evidence from other research groups, the claims about the Majorana 1 chip remain provisional.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="card card7">
        <h3>Potential Path Forward</h3>
        <p>Despite the skepticism, the pursuit of topological qubits remains a promising avenue in quantum computing research. 
            If Microsoft's claims are validated through further experimentation and peer review, it could represent a significant milestone.
             However, until such validation occurs, the scientific community remains cautious in embracing the purported breakthrough.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card8">
        <h3>Ambiguity in Evidence</h3>
        <p>The peer-reviewed Nature paper accompanying Microsoft's announcement describes an experimental setup that detects low-energy states via interferometry.
      However, the authors themselves acknowledge that these measurements "do not, by themselves, determine whether the low-energy states detected by interferometry are topological."
      This admission highlights the difficulty in conclusively identifying MZMs, as similar signatures can arise from non-topological phenomena like Andreev bound states.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card9">
        <p><center>Despite how exciting the promise this brings to the realm of quantum computing,<br>
      the Majorana chip is still a topic of debate and uncertainty. Experimental results are still inconclusive,<br>
      with challenges in distinguishing Majorana particles from other quasiparticles and replication finding across <br>
      different labs. These cast doubt on the chip's immediate viability and highlight the need for further validation<br>
       before it can be considered a reliable building block for scalable quantum systems.</center></p>
